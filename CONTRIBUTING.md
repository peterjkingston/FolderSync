# Requirements for Code Approval
Each implementation code file must have the following, described below:
* Documentation
* Interface Segregation
* Purpose 
* Style Compliance
* Test Classes

## Documentation
Minimum documentation currently includes:
* Single Responsibility for each class
* Brief description of what each method does
* Include each exception a method can throw
If you don't document as you code, then add incomplete documentation needs on the "Add Documentation" issue for that project, then do it later.

## Interface Segregation
For now, attempt to match existing new core classes to existing core interfaces. For supporting classes and interfaces specific to your feature, please feel free to write your own, but follow the Interface Segregation priciple.

## Have a Purpose
Site why initial contributions are needed. Provide at least one example where the issue can be a business / user need.

## Avoid being Frivilous
Don't add commits to fix formatting, or to fix spelling of symbols. If multiple code contributors participate in this project, a style guide will be enforced. An issue will be raised to bring previous code files incompliance with the style guide.
